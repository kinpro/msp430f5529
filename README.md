## MSP430 F5529 with PubNub

This demo app will send a "hello world" message from the MSP430 F5529 (in tandem with the CC3100 BoosterPack) via the PubNub Data Stream Network. 

It uses the PubNub Arduino client, tweaked for use with WiFi (per the instructions on the PubNub Arduino webpage: https://github.com/pubnub/arduino)

This should be enough to get you started with the TI MSP430 F5529 Launchpad via Energia with PubNub. For any other assistance with PubNub on this or any other MCUs, shoot us an email at support.

#### TODO
This demo uses the aJson lib, but there may be efficiencies to be gained by programatically assembling the JSON by hand instead.
